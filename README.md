# LSD
LSD is a streaming daemon that has been developed as a replacement for facebook's [scribe](https://github.com/facebookarchive/scribe) (it has been abandoned)

# Features
 - extremely high availability, reliability and local buffering capabilities, limited only by producer's disk storage capacity
 - lightweight text-based data format
 - simple configuration, deployment and support
 - ability to create complex routing schemes for different data streams
 - in general you don't need any specific library to send events (just write to plain files)

# How to install
_You must have either Linux or macOS (Windows and FreeBSD are not supported)_
```
go get github.com/badoo/lsd
$GOPATH/bin/lsd -c path_to_config
```

# Architecture

![Client-Server architecture](https://badoo.github.com/lsd/assets/lsd_architecture.jpg)

Producer application writes events (\n separated text lines of any format) into local files.

There is a local agent, called "LSD client" running on each host.

It watches these files and sends all new lines to remote receiver, called "LSD Server".

All events are split into categories based on file/directory name

## LSD Client

LSD Client uses inotify to watch for categories's files.

It also has rotate/delete mechanics to prevent superlarge/old files to appear.

### File name formats and write contract

```
lsd_dir/category_name.log
lsd_dir/category_name/*
```

All messages written to these files must be less than PIPE_BUF (4k in Linux by default). You must use append mode ("a" flag or O_APPEND) when sending events to prevent data from mixing.

If you want to write lines larger than PIPE_BUF, you must use the following file names and flock(LOCK_EX) for writing.
Maximum size for single line is 512k 

```
lsd_dir/category_name/*_big
lsd_dir/category_name_big.log
```

_You must also escape line breaks if they do appear inside you data_

### Rotate/delete flow

To keep workdir clean and small, LSD has to periodically delete data that has already been sent and delivered.

![Client rotate flow](https://badoo.github.io/lsd/assets/lsd_rotate.gif)

It does rotate on maxFileSize or periodically on fileRotateInterval, specified in config

Rotate algorithm:
1) move `lsd_dir/somecategory.log` => `lsd_dir/somecategory.log.old`
2) stream old and new files concurrently until every writer closes .old one
3) when nobody holds .old file (writers always open only .log) and it is fully streamed, LSD can safely delete .old and go to step 1.

_Keep in mind that writers have to periodically reopen current file in order to make LSD Client available to pass step 2_

### Best way to write to LSD

The most effective and reliable way is to write to small files, depending on current time
```
lsd_dir/category_name/year|month|day|hour|minute
```
for example
```
lsd_dir/category_name/201711031659
lsd_dir/category_name/201711031700
lsd_dir/category_name/201711031701
lsd_dir/category_name/201711031702
lsd_dir/category_name/201711031703
...
```

We have some client libraries that implement this logic:
- PHP
- Go 
- Java

(will be published soon)

_But you are free to just do open("filename", "a") => write_line() => close() and it will work fine_

## LSD Server

LSD Server accepts data from multiple LSD Clients and writes it to disk in separate chunks according to size/time threshold

![Server write flow](https://badoo.github.com/lsd/assets/lsd_server.gif)

```
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name-year-month-day_6 digits number (incrementing)
```

There is also a symlink that points to currently active file (which LSD Server writes to):
```
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name_current
```

Example:
```
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name-2016-12-01_000008
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name-2016-12-01_000009
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name-2016-12-01_000010
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name-2016-12-01_000011
lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name_current => lsd_server_dir/category_name/category_name-2016-12-01_000011
```

When threshold comes and `_000012` file is created, LSD atomically switches symlink to it. 

In this case consumer can process all files younger than one that is pointed by  `_current` symlink
(because LSD is writing to it or has already created next one, but didn't switch symlink yet).

We have some consumer libraries (will be published soon):
- PHP
- Go 
- Java

## Plain log mode

For simple cases when you just need to aggregate some logs from cluster to a single file, you can use

```"mode": "PLAIN_LOG"```

Then all input will be stored in a single <category_name>[.gz] file, which is reopened every `file_rotate_interval` seconds

# Configuration
Configuration is taken from `conf/lsd.conf` by default, but you can specify custom config with `-c <path>`

            "file_rotate_interval": 2
        },
    ],
}
```

## Relay mode (probably you won't need it)

![Relay example](https://badoo.github.com/lsd/assets/lsd_relay.jpg)

If you have multiple datacenters or too much producer hosts, you may need some multiplexers (called relays)

In this mode LSD works as both client and server in single daemon

Relay is a "fan in" in source DC for all category's data

Router is a "fan out" in target DC (sends to appropriate local servers)

`always_flock` is required in this case
```
"server_config": {
    "target_dir": "/local/lsd-storage-relay/",
    "max_file_size": 100000000,
    "file_rotate_interval": 60,
},
"client_config": {
    "source_dir": "/local/lsd-storage-relay/",
    "offsets_db": "/var/lsd/lsd-offsets-relay.db",
    "max_file_size": 100000000,
    "usage_check_interval": 60,
    "always_flock": true,
    "routing": [{
        "receivers": [                  
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
            {"addr": "lsd-router1.d4:3716", "weight": 1},
        ],
    }],
},
``` 

# Exploitation

## Daemon user
The best way to run LSD is to do it under the same user that writes to files. If multiple users write to filesystem then you will need to run LSD as root (not recommended) or give it permissions to stat() open file descriptors using `setcap`.
LSD periodically checks all files that are going to be deleted and deletes only when no one holds them 
(it will delete rotated files immediately in case of wrong permissions)

## Resource usage
Both client and server have low rusage (it grows in case of gzip: true), but consume memory, proportional to number of categories streamed.
You can reduce absolute memory usage by tuning buffer sizes in config, but with default settings in badoo's usecase it's average memory usage is less then 1gb RSS

## Healthchecks

You can run subcommand healthcheck to receive current LSD status
```
lsd healthcheck -c path_to_config
```
It returns current status of lsd daemon for given config.

Example:
```
lsd_experiment healthcheck -c /local/lsd/etc/lsd.conf | jq '.'
{
  "is_running": true,
  "client": {
    "undelivered": {
      "debug_mgalanin_cluster_priority": 0,
      "debug_mgalanin_stop_word_complaint": 0,
      "debug_movchinnikov_sanction_descent": 0,
      "error_log": 0,
      "fast_stats": 0,
      "local_compressed_uds_json_2": 7668,
      "local_uds_debug_gpb": 269,
      "local_uds_gpb_hdfs_1": 0,
      "local_uds_gpb_instant": 0,
      "mdk": 0,
      "spam_clustering_user_features": 0,
      "spam_clustering_user_features_6h": 0,
      "spam_generic": 118,
      "spam_messages": 258,
      "stat_events": 0
    },
    "backlog_size": 1,
    "errors": []
  },
  "server": {
    "categories": {
        "spam_stopword_text": {
            "count": 1,
            "oldest_ts": 1499350267
        },
        "spam_text": {
            "count": 11,
            "oldest_ts": 1510421666
        },
        "spam_timeout": {
            "count": 26,
            "oldest_ts": 1510421660
        },
        "spam_vpn_train_colle": {
            "count": 0,
            "oldest_ts": 0
        }
    },
    "errors": []
  }
}
```
It returns two sections for client and server part of config (they can run in a single daemon)

`client` contains number of undelivered bytes for each category

`server` contains count of files for each category (waiting to be processed)

Both sections also have array of generic errors.

## HDFS transfer
You can transfer files directly from LSD server's workdir to HDFS with specific sub command. 
```
lsd transfer-hdfs -dst-dir=hdfs_dst_dir -tmp-dir=temp_dir_for_upload -namenode=username@host:port -delete=true|false "category name pattern"
```
Category pattern has standard "bash glob" syntax.

All files from LSD server dirs will be transferred to hdfs with current_hostname_ prefix (to make files unique)

## GZIP
You can compress LSD traffic in two ways:
1) between client and server
2) from server to FS (also supports `gzip_parallel`)
With `gzip: true` in appropriate config section

# Internals
_At most daemon's code is self documented_

## Client

![Client internal architecture](https://badoo.github.io/lsd/assets/lsd_client_internals.jpg)

### FS router
Listens inotify for base dir, adds watches on subdirs if they appear

Extracts category/stat for each event and passes categoryEvent to specific categoryListener that is responsible for category

If some category and it's listener get stuck (too many events/network issues/etc), we should not block whole fs router in order to keep other categories streamed

That's why we have "backlog" - table with filenames that are postponed. Backlog is flushed into main events queue periodically   

We also have background check, that periodically scans all files in order to pick-up orphan/lost and restore consistency (should not be useful often)

### Category listener
Receives events for specific category. Stores all active files and associated info inside.

Reads file contents from disk and writes to network balancer's input channel

Also provides rotate mechanics and deletes old rotated files (with usageChecker)  

### Usage checker
Periodically scans procfs to detect "free" files (those are no longer opened by writers)

We don't use lsof because it takes too much time/resources to execute lsof for each watched file

### Traffic manager
Stores and exposes out/in traffic stats with expvar

### Network router
Just a proxy that stores all category => out network channel mappings

### Balancer
One balancer per category group in config. Stores all upstreams and balances events traffic between them.

Registers all sent events and confirms all events, that are accepted by remote LSD server (updates offsetsDB).

### Upstream
Sends event batches to LSD server on specific host.

## Server
LSD server is pretty simple, it accepts event batches from network and writes them to disk. Nothing else.

GPBHandler => listener => writer => FS
